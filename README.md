# [FiveM Launcher](https://fivem.net)

A simple launcher to FiveM servers. I see a lot of people selling these launchers and I can't believe some people pay for it. It's just two buttons with two simple features. One button will open the FiveM and join a server. The other will clean the cache of the game. Why people charge for this?

Anyway, this is the "mega launcher" for free. You can change the logo, the background and the links for what you want.
